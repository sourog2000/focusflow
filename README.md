# FocusFlow

FocusFlow is a simple task and habit tracking web application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The project focuses on strengthening core frontend fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, state management, and browser-based persistence.

## Overview

The application allows users to manage daily tasks and habits in a clean, minimal interface.
All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, ensuring persistence across page reloads.

This project was built as a learning-focused portfolio project.
